User Story:
======
AS a senior engineer working on an e-commerce platform

I WANT my platform to use Redux to manage global state instead of the Context API

SO THAT my website's state management is taken out of the React ecosystem

Description:
======
For the Redux assignment, I've refactored the e-commerce platform from the module project so that it uses Redux, which remains the industry standard for managing complex state in a large-scale React application
